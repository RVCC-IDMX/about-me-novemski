# Yahor Zaitsau - About Me

![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/YOUR_NETLIFY_BADGE_HERE/deploy-status)

## Description
This project is a personal About Me web page created to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive web design.

Throughout this project, I developed the following skills:

-Structuring content using elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.
-Styling the page with Flexbox and Grid layouts, hover effects, custom fonts, and media queries for responsive design.
-Implemented a fully functional contact form with Netlify Forms, including mandatory and optional fields.
-Added `alt` text for images, used clear labels for form fields, and ensured a logical tab order.
-Embedded images and videos to showcase hobbies, interests, and HTML coding.
-Documented color choices and layout decisions for efficiency and organization.
