                <h2>Dracula</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick
                        descent, but in the
                        main always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of
                        the fact that the
                        driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the
                        courtyard of a vast
                        ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray
                        of light, and whose
                        broken battlements showed a jagged line against the
                        moonlit sky.</p>

                    <p>The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A
                        stone falling from
                        the window would fall a thousand feet without touching
                        anything! As far as
                        the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with
                        occasionally a deep rift
                        where there is a chasm. Here and there are silver
                        threads where the rivers
                        wind in deep gorges through the forests.</p>

                    <p>I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on
                        me. It is destroying
                        my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all
                        sorts of horrible
                        imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my
                        terrible fear in this
                        accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse,
                        bathed in soft
                        yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day.</p>
