                    <p>Welcome to my website where I will be showcasing some of
                        my hobbies/interests,
                        pictures, videos, and other fun stuff. My main hobbies
                        would be listening to
                        music, climbing, and playing guitar. Some of my favorite
                        artists/bands would
                        include Mk.Gee, the Strokes, Frank Ocean, and Dijon. I
                        myself play a modified
                        Gretsch guitar which has been set up in baritone tuning.
                        My max climbing grade
                        is V10 on the 2016 Moonboard set. I also enjoy watching
                        a variety of things.
                        Some movies I enjoy are “Good Time”, “Interstellar”, and
                        “The Revenant”. Some
                        shows that I have enjoyed are “Breaking Bad” and “The
                        Boys”. Animes that are
                        good include things like “Naruto”, “HxH”, “Tokyo Ghoul”,
                        and “JJK”. While I am
                        not a big reader, I do enjoy reading mangas like
                        “Climber”, “Vagabond”, and
                        “Berserk”. This website was built as part of my Web Page
                        Development course that
                        I am taking at Raritan Valley Community College with
                        professor Caruso. It is a
                        mandatory class needed for the IT/IS degree. This class
                        is my first experience
                        with web page development and I have definitely learned
                        a lot over the course of
                        the semester. While coding isn't necessarily a big
                        passion of mine, I have found
                        that HTML (especially through VSCode) is actually quite
                        user friendly and easy
                        to use, which overall created a great experience.

                <h2>Image Hover Deep Dive</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>In the world of modern web design, first impressions
                        matter. Visitors expect a
                        site that not only
                        looks good, but also feels interactive and intuitive.
                        One powerful and
                        surprisingly simple way
                        to enhance user experience is through image hover
                        effects.
                        These effects occur when
                        a user moves their cursor over an image and something
                        visually changes to showcase an interactive image.
                        From subtle size changes to animated overlays, hover
                        effects help websites feel
                        dynamic, engaging,
                        and purposeful.
                        According to a design glossary, hover effects can
                        involve changes in
                        color, shape, brightness,
                        or movement when the mouse pointer hovers over an
                        element like an image or
                        button. These cues make
                        a site feel more polished and help users recognize where
                        they can click or
                        explore further. </p>

                    <p>A deeper dive into hover effects reveals why designers
                        rely on them to enhance
                        usability. As users
                        explore a site, responsive feedback—such as an image
                        growing slightly or
                        shifting color—lets them
                        know their cursor actions have meaning. This immediate
                        feedback can improve
                        navigation and encourage visitors to stay longer
                        on a site. Furthermore,
                        hover effects add
                        visual depth that makes a layout feel less static and
                        more alive. Adding hover effects isn’t just about
                        aesthetics—there are practical advantages
                        too. The biggest one being is the
                        engaging visuals can make a website feel more intuitive.
                        This increases time spent on the site and lures the user
                        into exploring more
                        content.
                        This technique does have its limitations. Hover effects
                        rely on
                        mouse interactions, which means they may not work on
                        touchscreens or mobile
                        devices. Designers must ensure that hover effects are
                        accessible and
                        provide alternative interactions for users on different
                        platforms.
